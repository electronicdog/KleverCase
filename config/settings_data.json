    "question_one": "How long will delivery take? What are your Christmas cut-offs?",
    "answer_one": "We generally dispatch within 1-2 working days. All products are sent by 2nd class Royal Mail postage unless specified and this adds 1-2 days for UK delivery. International orders are sent by Royal Mail international standard post untracked. See our delivery and returns page for estimated shipping periods for specific countries\/regions. <p>Estimated delivery periods: UK: 1-2 Days, EU: 5-10 Days, US: 3-5 days (non-personalised) 7-14 Days (personalised), ROW: 7-21 Days. <p> We will dispatch UK orders made up to 12pm on the 22nd December 2015 using Tracked 24 post as standard or next day delivery from 23rd December if paid for at checkout. Use guide above for non-UK delivery lead times.",
    "question_two": "What are the tech Covers and Diaries made from?",
    "answer_two": "All of our products are made using locally sourced premium materials including woven bookbinding paper, durable card and wax laminate finish. Designs are high quality prints that imitate cloth and leather originals. They are not made from actual leather or cloth.",
    "question_three": "Can I bend the tech cover back on itself like a paperback book?",
    "answer_three": "Most of our covers are made like hardback books and cannot be bent backwards. However, certain designs have this functionality at an extra cost and are named 'foldback case'",
    "question_four": "Do the tech covers have a closing magnet and sleep\/wake functionality?",
    "answer_four": "Covers have an elastic strap which keeps the cover closed in transit and when reading in the bent back position. Printed iphone covers have a magnet closure and a magnet feature to keep the cover open whilst taking calls. None of our covers incorporate sleep\/wake functionality but allow for easy access to the power button.",
    "question_five": "What part of the covers or files can I personalise?",
    "answer_five": "Tech covers and Stationery can be personalised on the inside bookplate. Add a message on the product page using the correct punctuation and spelling and we will lay it out in traditional font. Storage Files can be personalised on the spine with up to 3 lines of 10 characters.",
    "question_six": "Which devices work with KleverCases?",
    "answer_six": "Our tech covers use a new reusable sticking technology which means almost any  6\" or 7\" ereader or tablet can work with our covers. We also offer an added protective cradle for the most popular devices for the heaviest of use. See the individual product page size guides for lists of compatible devices.",
    "question_seven": "Will you be making cases for larger devices like ipad, iphone 6 plus and 8\" tablets?",
    "answer_seven": "Unfortunately not, we have found that the book cover concept doesn't scale up very well for the larger devices so we have no plans to make covers that are compatible with devices larger than those with a 7 inch screen. We have also found that our covers are not suitable for iphone 6 plus so have no plans for this model.",
    "question_eight": "Can you make a customised cover for me ie Harry Potter, or The Hobbit?",
    "answer_eight": "We can only offer the designs available on this site. Newer titles require licensing and we are not currently exploring this option.",
    "question_nine": "How can I find out about new products, offers and competitions?",
    "answer_nine": "We have a very active facebook page where we often run competitions and offers. Click the social media icons at the bottom of any page to follow us or enter your email address for our very occasional email updates.",
    "question_ten": "Do you sell from websites or shops in other countries (ie the USA)?",
